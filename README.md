# FRC-2020
Iron Panthers Repository for the FIRST Robotics Competition 2020 Game, Infinite Recharge.

This branch is for use of driver practice and for use at CalGames 2021. As such, it'll be slightly unstable -- main branch will be used at competition.

Obvious TODOS:
- [ ] Prevent jamming (it is acceptable to not count 5 cells)
- [ ] Obvious controls to eject through intake, main flywheel
- [ ] Driving controls (tune to new drivers' preferences)
- [ ] Clarify shot setpoint controls (remove reduntant controls, add valuable ones)
- [ ] Create controls writeup/graphic
- [ ] Simple autonomous that doesn't leave a hard-to-exit state for teleop
